Task: I want to build a multi-agents system that would simulate ways to re-balance my financial assets portfolio.

Context:
The problem I want to solve is how to find strategies to re-balance my portfolio composed of stocks, bonds, crypto and real-estate.
If you would let a team of agents rebalancing your portfolio, what would be the performance of the portfolio compared to its initial state? 

Agent workflow:
1- takes in a portfolio with a list of assets and ISIN (if available)
2- takes in investor profile (time horizon, risk levels, dos/donts)
3- research a strategy
4- recommend re-balancing portfolio
5- simulate the trade of assets (stock, bonds, etfs, crypto) via polygon
6- Report on trading activity
7= Report on portfolio performance vs initial state

tools:
The course has 6 MCPs servers & 44 tools -> check which MCP you want
No push notification

codebase:
- each component needs its test
- organize the codebase by python modules
- Produce a good readme with documentation, architecture

UI: (maybe not)
- deploy with gradio on hugging face
- See start portfolio, new state portfolio, see difference between both
- Report list of trades sorted by most recent
- Report short summary of re-balancing strategy
- Be able to ask question to the researcher with chat window
